# DANN(Domain Adversarial Neural Network)
Implementation of [DANN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07818) in Tensorflow 2.0 environment. Written for Deepest season 6 recruiting project.

## Project Requirements
1. Implementation of Gradient Reversal Layer(GRL) [x]
2. Implementation of feature extractor, class classifier, domain classifier [x]
3. Input data resize and normalization [x]
4. Preparing at least 2 datasets [x]
5. Target classification accuracy above 70% [x]
- Comparison between source-only and DANN model [x]
